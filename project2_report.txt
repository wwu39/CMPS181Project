2. Meta-data
- Show your meta-data design (Tables and Columns table) and information about each column.

Tables and Columns are generated as record based paged file. 
Tables stores records with fields table-id, table-name, file-name.
When catalog is created, Tables initializes as follow:

table-id | table-name | file-name
    1    | Tables     | Tables
    2    | Columns    | Columns
Columns stores records with fields table-id, column-name, column-type, column-length, column-position.
When catalog is created, Tables initializes as follow:

table-id |   column-name   | column-type | column-length | column-position
    1    | table-id        | INT         | 4             | 1
    1    | table-name      | VARCHAR     | 50            | 2
    1    | file-name       | VARCHAR     | 50            | 3
    2    | table-id        | INT         | 4             | 1
    2    | column-name     | VARCHAR     | 50            | 2
    2    | column-type     | INT         | 4             | 3
    2    | column-length   | INT         | 4             | 4
    2    | column-position | INT         | 4             | 5


Everytime a new table is created, a tuple (table-id, table-name, file-name) is inserted to Tables;
all of its columns (table-id, column-name, column-type, column-length, column-position) are insert to Columns.

getAttributes: to get all the attributes for a specific table t
    for each record rd in Tables
        if record.table-name = t, then id <- record.table-id
    for each record rd in Columns
        if record.table-id = id, then attrs.push_back( {rd.column-name, rd.column-type, rd.column-position} )
        
Everytime a new table is deleted, remove the corresponding file.
